Streamoid Backend Challenge: Product Catalog Service
Welcome! This repository contains my solution for the Streamoid Backend Intern/Fresher take-home exercise. I have developed a robust backend service designed to help online sellers validate and manage their product data before listing it on major marketplaces.
The service is built using FastAPI for high-performance API handling and SQLAlchemy with SQLite for reliable data persistence.
